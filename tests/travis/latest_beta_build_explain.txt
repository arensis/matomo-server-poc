What is this build?
-------------------
This build is running against the latest Matomo beta version as no maximum
supported version in plugin.json is specified.

If you want to run this build against a fixed Matomo version, specifiy either a
maximum supported Matomo version in plugin.json like this:

'require": { "matomo": ">=2.15.0-rc1,<=2.15.0-rc1" },'

or specify a specific "PIWIK_TEST_TARGET" Matomo version in your ".travis.yml".


Why is this important?
----------------------
Studies show that it is more efficient and best to find problems as early as
possible. In general we want to find possible problems as early as possible
and while you are working on the plugin anyway. This way you can make the
plugin compatible immediately instead of having to look into it in a few weeks
again. Also if you identify a bug in Matomo we can provide fixes much faster
and the build will automatically become green once we release a new beta.


What to do when this build fails?
---------------------------------
* Identify the cause of failure
* Report a bug in Matomo core https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues in case
  it is a bug in Matomo
* Make your plugin compatible with the latest Matomo version
* If you cannot make your plugin compatible with the latest Matomo version,
  specify a maximum supported Matomo version in your plugin.json file like this:
  '"require": { "matomo": ">=2.15.0-rc1,<=2.15.0-rc1" },'
* If you need any help with this contact the Matomo core team
